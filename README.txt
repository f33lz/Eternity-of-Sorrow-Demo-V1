Thanks for downloading the Eternity of Sorrow mod demo.
To play the mod, apply the xdelta patch to a clean rom 
of Dawn of Sorrow using XDelta http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/598/

There is only currently one know issue with the mod that I do not yet know how to fix;
Upon starting a new game, the map will not appear or fill in on the top screen until you either save and reload the game or enter a warp room.
